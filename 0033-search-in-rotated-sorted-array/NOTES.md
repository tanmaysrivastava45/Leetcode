â€‹in this code we could have applied linear search but since it was asking for time complexity O(logn) so we did the binary search 
now for binary search we did two things that is we first checked whether arr[mid] is equal to target then we made two cases that is 
1) we did search in the left sorted array then
2) we did search in the right sorted array  if the eliment is not found in the left array
