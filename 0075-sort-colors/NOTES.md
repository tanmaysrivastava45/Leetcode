This question can be done by any kind of sorting technique 
1) Selection sort : In selection sort we will be running two loops first we will fix the smallest number in left side by swapping it with the very first element
   and we will be doing the same thing again till the array is sorted
   time complexity= O(n^2)
   space complexity = O(1)
   best case time complexity = O(n^2)
   worst case time complexity = O(N^2)â€‹
   it is unstable code : it  did not guarantee you that it will retain its order or not;
2) Bubble sort :In this type off sorting we will we be comparing the adjacent elements and will be swapping accordingly
  time complexity :O(n^2)
  space complexity :O(1)
  best case time complexity = O(n)
  --- for best case we will be using break statement to exit the loop as i did in question no 75 3rd submission 
  worst case complexity = O(n^2)
  for code visit - Sorting_BubbleSort.cpp
  it is an stable code :they did retain the original order of the element
3) Insertion sort : like card example inserting according to sorting
time complexity :O(n^2)
space complexity :O(1)
best case time complexity = O(n)
worst case complexity = O(n^2)
for code visit - Sorting_InsertionSort.cpp
it is an stable code
