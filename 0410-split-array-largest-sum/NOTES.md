â€‹this problem comes under the advanced problem section in binary search which we studied in lecture 15
the method to this question is mentioned below:-
1) first we will make a function to perform binary search and we will store the ans to it but we will look for min sum so we will be adjusting the e and s accordingly
2) then we will be making the boolean function for checking the sum that whether it is capable of storing it in the limits of k or it has to be relooked
3) we will be calling the second function in first function
